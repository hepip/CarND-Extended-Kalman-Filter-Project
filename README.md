# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project we will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Simulated lidar and radar measurements detecting a bicycle that travels around your vehicle is provided. Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements to track the bicycle's position and velocity.

This project involves a Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)


INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)

Each row represents a sensor measurement where the first column tells you if the measurement comes from radar (R) or lidar (L).

For a row containing radar data, the columns are: sensor_type, rho_measured, phi_measured, rhodot_measured, timestamp, x_groundtruth, y_groundtruth, vx_groundtruth, vy_groundtruth, yaw_groundtruth, yawrate_groundtruth.

For a row containing lidar data, the columns are: sensor_type, x_measured, y_measured, timestamp, x_groundtruth, y_groundtruth, vx_groundtruth, vy_groundtruth, yaw_groundtruth, yawrate_groundtruth.

Whereas radar has three measurements (rho, phi, rhodot), lidar has two measurements (x, y).

The three main steps for programming a Kalman filter:

1. Initializing Kalman filter variables
2. Predicting where our object is going to be after a time step Î”t
3. Updating where our object is based on sensor measurements

Then the prediction and update steps repeat themselves in a loop.

To measure how well our Kalman filter performs, we will then calculate root mean squared error comparing the Kalman filter results with the provided ground truth.

OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]

## Generating Additional Data for Experiments

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
